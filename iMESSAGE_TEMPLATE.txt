🏠 Hey! I'd love your feedback on AFHhub - our new platform for the Adult Family Home industry.

It's a unified portal with 3 apps:
🔍 Provider Search (580+ providers)
🏠 Property Advisor (property analysis)
🏥 Placement Services (intelligent matching)

Check it out: http://localhost:3000

(Currently local - I can help you set it up or we can do a demo!)

Please review:
✓ Landing page design & navigation
✓ The 3 application sections
✓ Case studies section
✓ Overall user experience
✓ Mobile responsiveness

What works? What needs improvement? Any missing features?

Thanks! 🙏
